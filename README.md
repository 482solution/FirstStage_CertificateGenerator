This shell script creates a digitally signed certificate for REMME system. To create such a certificate you need to create a transaction to manage this certificate and provide the TXID and the number of transaction output to manage this certificate. Once the provided output is spent, certificate is considered as revoked by the system. Note that you have to use special middleware to utilize such certificates.
